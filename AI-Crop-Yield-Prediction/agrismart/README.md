      "cost": "$50-75 per acre"
    }
  ],
  "last_updated": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

#### Features:
- **5-minute Caching** - Optimized API calls with intelligent caching
- **OpenWeatherMap Integration** - Real-time weather data for soil analysis
- **Supabase Storage** - Persistent data storage with user authentication
- **Fallback System** - LocalStorage and mock data fallbacks for offline use

### Frontend Components

#### SoilHealthCard Component
Located at: `src/pages/dashboard/components/SoilHealthCard.jsx`

**Features:**
- Real-time data fetching with JWT authentication
- Interactive charts with toggle between NPK levels and 7-day trends
- Responsive design with mobile optimization
- Health status indicators with color coding
- Recommendations display with priority badges
- Manual refresh functionality

**Chart Visualization:**
- **NPK Bar Chart** - Current nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels
- **7-Day Trend Lines** - Historical data visualization for pH, moisture, and nutrients
- **Responsive Design** - Optimized for desktop and mobile viewing

### Database Schema

#### Supabase `soil_health` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE soil_health (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    data JSONB NOT NULL,
    fetched_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_soil_health_user_id ON soil_health(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_soil_health_fetched_at ON soil_health(fetched_at);

-- Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE soil_health ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- RLS Policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own soil health data" ON soil_health
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own soil health data" ON soil_health
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own soil health data" ON soil_health
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Usage Instructions

#### 1. Environment Setup
Ensure your `.env` file includes:
```env
VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

#### 2. Database Setup
1. Copy the schema from `supabase_schema.sql`
2. Execute in your Supabase SQL editor
3. Verify tables and policies are created

#### 3. Component Integration
```jsx
import SoilHealthCard from './components/SoilHealthCard';

function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div className="dashboard">
      <SoilHealthCard />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### 4. Styling
The component includes comprehensive CSS styling in `SoilHealthCard.css` with:
- Responsive design breakpoints
- Dark mode support
- Animation effects
- Color-coded health indicators

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:
1. **API Authentication Errors** - Ensure JWT token is properly stored in localStorage
2. **Chart Rendering Issues** - Verify Recharts is properly installed
3. **Styling Problems** - Check CSS import and Tailwind configuration
4. **Data Loading Failures** - Component includes fallback to localStorage and mock data

#### Fallback Behavior:
1. **Primary**: API endpoint with real-time data
2. **Secondary**: LocalStorage cached data
3. **Tertiary**: Mock data for demonstration

### Performance Optimizations
- **Caching Strategy** - 5-minute cache for API calls
- **Lazy Loading** - Charts load only when needed
- **Responsive Images** - Optimized for different screen sizes
- **Error Boundaries** - Graceful error handling
